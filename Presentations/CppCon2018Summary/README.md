On the following meeting(s) we'll be discousing about it.

## Bjarne Stroustrup: "Concepts: The Future of Generic Programming (the future is here)"
"The future" has been becoming for years... It turns out that C++ concepts it's not brand new idea. The need of improving generic code with "compile time predicates" has been noticed and some approaches has been performed. Finally in 2016 TS containing concepts was approved and has been available in GCC since version 6 (-fconcepts) - no clang support yet. Currently, concepts are in working draft for C++20.

Concepts help develop better design, provide better specification interface, simplify code and give precise, early error messages.
