# Abstract

Building C++ using different toolchains should be easy. Reproducing your build, test, 
and production environment shouldn't be hard either. If you assume this is just wishful thinking, 
this is a talk for you. If you don't, come listen how, thanks to Docker, it's easy to make those things a bliss.

In this talk, we'll demonstrate how to containerize your app effortlessly using Docker and CMake.
What's more, you'll also see how to use Docker to provide a uniform build environment for all your developers.
Cross-platform development and reproducible builds have never been easier.
Last but not least, we'll show you how to easily deploy complex applications right on your developer VMs
